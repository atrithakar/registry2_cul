### 🧠 What is This?

This repo was created to test the **multiple registries** feature in **Project CUL**.  
It allowed simulating a custom registry environment, as real-world users might want to self-host their own module registry.

---

## 🚨 DEPRECATION NOTICE

This backend served as a **prototype** and has now been replaced with a more performant architecture.  
The current backend uses **FastAPI** and **MongoDB** for speed, flexibility, and scalability.

The production database here is **READ-ONLY**, and this repo is no longer actively maintained.  
However, you can still **explore the system** using the test credentials below.
